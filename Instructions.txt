To create a pull request:

Create a github account
Click on the button on that page that says "fork"
Using either the terminal or a github gui, download or "clone" the repo that you just forked.
Make the edits you want to make, in this case you can add your name to the index.html file.
"Commit" your changes -- this will save them locally
Push your changes -- this will save them on your forked repo
Create a pull request by going back to the original repo and pressing the button that says "pull request".
Press "compare across forks" and where it has the drop down list saying head fork you should find your forked repo.
Choose that and then you can submit the pull request.
